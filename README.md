# random-site-project
A project dedicated to creating a huge database of random links.

# What is this?
As said, a project dedicated to creating a very large DB of random links.

The way I got the links was crawling them via a custom crawling program I made.

All links are publically avalible, if you want your own down, make an issue and it'll be fixed.

# Why?
I made this because there hasn't been a true **universal** website generator. Most are just people who have a bunch of projects they put into a "generator."
This is truely the closest thing I can think off, it doesn't cost money and is easy. I will update in batches of links, usually 1k-5k more every time.

# Sidenotes:
After every update, you most likely have to clear your cache for your browser to load in the new links.

I'm also the only person working on this, so development will be slow. If you'd like to help, make a crawler (I recommend scrapy, which is Python) and make an issue with the list of links.
